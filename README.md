# What is hf-training?

We are experimenting with and training ourselves in the use of
[git-hubflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/GitFlowForGitHub.html)

Contains public material of no significance.

# How do I start using it?

This project uses Hubflow with default settings.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:cancerit/hf-training.git
cd hf-training
git hf init
```

(You don't need that `-a` on `init`.)
